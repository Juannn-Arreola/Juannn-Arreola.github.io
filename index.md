## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs Lab 1

This was my favorite part of the lab because it was such a brand new experience for me and in this lab we were learning how to clone,push,commit and status our code and also being able to print out “Hello World!” and then replace the word World with our names.

Lab 8, Part 2 
This lab was also one of my favorites mainly because we created a game called poker and it showed many things that I didn’t even know about poker and it was just a new experience understanding how the game poker worked. I played with family and friends and many of them also learned how to play poker just from the lab that we created.

Lab 3, Part 1 
This lab was my last favorite mainly because we used the equation BMR so that we can calculate the basal metabolic rate they were learning to write a function definition in this part and I even used this part to calculate my own BMR after the lab and this was something new and fun that I learned about even myself.
